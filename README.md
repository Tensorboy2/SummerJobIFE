# SummerJobIFE
## By Sigurd Vargdal

## Plan
This repo will contain the code form a summer job as IFE 2025. 
The code will include usage of Google earth engine and use deep learning to identify the location of all floating photovoltaic (FPV) systems in the world. 

## Notes
- The Landsat 8 (30m x 30m) has too low resolution to show the solar plants. (17.8.2025) 
- Yang et al. dataset is tensorflow formed, so must use tensorflow on those samples.
- To train network on cpu use: mini unet, amp, compile
